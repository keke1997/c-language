// Write a number guessing game, which will generate an integer number between 1
// and 100, and let the user to guess the number within 5 turns. After each
// guess, the program will tell if the number is higher or lower. If the user is
// out of guesses, the program will show the number generated.
// After the game, the program will prompt the user to play again or not. If 'y'
// is typed, the game will restart, else the program will terminate.
//
// For example, suppose the program generate random number of 4
//
// Program Execution Example:
// Guess the number (5 guesses remaining): 10
// Wrong, it is lower.
// Guess the number (4 guesses remaining): 5
// Wrong, it is lower.
// Guess the number (3 guesses remaining): 2
// Wrong, it is higher.
// Guess the number (2 guesses remaining): 4
// Correct! The magic number is 4.
// Would you like to play again? n
// Have a wonderful day!
